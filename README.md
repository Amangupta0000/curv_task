# cruv_task
I first created the seat model class withseat number & seat type as parameter.
then seat widget which takes seat number, seat type ,search bar text.
then cabin widget which is a group of 8 seat widgets and giving seat type , seat index,searchbartext.
In this task , I use riverpod package to pass the user input seat number to cabin widget  so that seat color changes when user search the specific seat number.
I used stateprovider class of riverpod which read the changes in searchBar field.
I user press search button without typing any seat number then a snackbar is shown to tell user enter valid seat number.

Thankyou..
